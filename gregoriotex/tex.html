<h1><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span></h1>

<p>This page is intended for the many people wishing to use Gregorio but not yet acquainted with <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>.  For the installation of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> and Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> system, refer to the <a href="/installation.html">installation</a> page.</p>

<h2>What is <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>?</h2>

<p><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> (pronounced tek) is a language created by Donald E. Knuth in 1977, for the purpose of creating documents. In one sense, it is a non-graphical program for text processing (in contrast with MS-Word, for example, which is a graphical program). To clarify, one creates a text file containing the desired text of the document and formatting commands (setting this portion of text in bold, another portion in italics, changing the font, the spacing, etc.).  One invokes <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> on this text file, and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> will produce a PDF file or DVI file (a format easily convertible into Postscript or PDF).</p>

<p>The trouble with <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> is that it is a rather complex language, whose learning curve is acknowledged to be a bit long.  The advantage is, however, a rendering very often nicely superior to other text processors, notably for example in the rendering of mathematical formulas, a field in which there is really no competition.   As well, <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> has the advantage of being extremely programmable.</p>

<p><span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> is a more expanded collection of very-high-level macros (and therefore easier to use). Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> is programmed in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, so its code can be used in <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> and Plain <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>.</p>

<h2>Why did you have to use <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>?</h2>

<p>The first reason that impelled me to use <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> is that it's a free (non-proprietary) language (in the public domain), ported to various OSes, and capable of producing these types of scores.  The aim of gregorio is to be usable by everyone freely and without charge, and thus that excludes proprietary commercial software for computer-aided publishing. So aside from <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> the choice was quite limited, since there are very few text processors as programmable (making Gregorian chant scores is less easy than it might appear).</p>

<p>Furthermore, <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> can be used to produce complete books of professional quality (cf. <a href="./gregoriotex/example.html">examples</a>), so using <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> does not reduce the possible usages of gregorio.</p>

<h2>Why and how to learn <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>?</h2>

<p>Even if theoretically you won't have to modify the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> files produced by gregorio at all, or perhaps very little, it is necessary for you to have at least some idea of the basics in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> to understand and modify them.  Moreover, I eagerly encourage everyone to graduate to <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, because even though it is more complex than point-and-click desktop publishing software, you will not be disappointed with the result.</p>

<p>Be aware in advance that learning <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> will demand of you time and energy. When you're used to software with a graphical interface, it is easy to be disoriented or discouraged at the learning curve of a language such as <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>.  In the meantime, after some effort at the outset, the language reveals itself to be very powerful and the renderings more than satisfactory.</p>

<p>To learn <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, a lot of tutorials are available on the net, as well as several excellent books. To get you started, here is the <a href="http://www.tug.org/begin.html">TUG introduction</a> (TUG, the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> Users Group, is the non-profit which maintains the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live distribution, quite possibly the most popular <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> distribution).</p>

<h2>What are the different versions of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>?</h2>

<p>What we usually call <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, is in fact a combination of a format, written in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> (usually Plain <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> or Con<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>t) and an engine, the executable file (<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>82, PDF<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, Xe<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> or Lua<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>). Gregorio actively uses the features of <a href="http://www.luatex.org/">Lua<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span></a>.</p>
