<h1><!--#echo var="title" --></h1>

<p>Four free examples are available here. I have built them during an internship I made in the <a href="http://osbnorcia.org">Monastero di San Benedetto in Norcia</a> between April and June 2008. These are real and concrete examples of what monasteries need.</p>

<p>These examples are available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/en/" title="">Creative Commons</a> licence. Their source code is available too. If you see modifications that would be needed, or if you want specific versions for your needs (donations are accepted), do not hesitate to write to me.</p>

<p>These examples have been produced with non-free fonts, so you probably won't be able to compile the source code, you'll need to adapt it.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/laudes.pdf" title="">first example</a>, the smallest, is a chant sung during the adoration (<a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/laudes.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/complies.pdf" title="">second</a> does not contain scores. It is the Benedictine office of compline in latin, with the french translation (<a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/complies.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/benedictionessmall.pdf" title="">third</a> is a small paper for guests in monasteries to remember the benedictions of the meals (<a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/benedictiones-small.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/benedictiones.pdf" title="">fourth</a> is the entire book of the benedictions of the meals in the monastery in Norcia, entirely in latin. It is very complete and contains a lot of scores (<a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/examples/benedictiones.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>As you can see, it is possible to obtain professional results with TeX and GregorioTeX. None of these scores has taken me more than 3 minutes (with the debug) to write, so gregorio is really a fast software.</p>
