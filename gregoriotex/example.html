<h1>Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> Examples</h1>

<p>Several examples are made available here.  These are real and concrete examples of what monasteries need.</p>

<h3>O Antiphons Project</h3>

<p>As an example of a multi-part project using the current version of Gregorio (4.2), we have the O Anitphons produced by Br. Samuel Springuel for St. Anselm's Abbey.  <a href="../examples/O_Antiphons/O_Antiphons.zip">The whole project</a> consits of several documents:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../examples/O_Antiphons/Proof.pdf">Proof.pdf</a>:</dt> <dd>This one simply prints each score once.  This makes it ideal for checking to proofing the text and music to make sure everything is as indended.  It also contains the Magnificat tone and text as it was found in the source.</dd>

<dt><a href="../examples/O_Antiphons/O_Antiphons_booklet.pdf">O_Antiphons_booklet.pdf</a>:</dt> <dd>This is a booklet on letter paper containing just the O Antiphons themselves.  Each antiphon has its own page and the booklet design incorporates artwork, font variations, and color to improve the look.</dd>

<dt><a href="../examples/O_Antiphons/Magnificat_booklet.pdf">Magnificat_booklet.pdf</a>:</dt> <dd>This file is a companion to O_Antiphons_booklet, containing the text of the Magnificat fully written out with the notes and formatted into a booklet on letter paper.  By having it as a separate booklet, there is less page flipping in use.</dd>

<dt><a href="../examples/O_Antiphons/O_Antiphons_expanded.pdf">O_Antiphons_expanded.pdf</a>:</dt> <dd>This file provides a separate 2-page handout for each O Antiphon which includes the Magnificat text.  This makes it ideal for creating a handout which is specific to a particular day.</dd>
</dl>

See the README.txt file in the <a href="../examples/O_Antiphons/O_Antiphons.zip">source download</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Legacy examples</h3>

<p>The following examples were built by Ã‰lie Roux during an internship he made at the <a href="http://osbnorcia.org">Monastero di San Benedetto in Norcia</a> between April and June 2008. Given their age, however, they no longer can be compiled with the current version of Gregorio and would require significant work to bring them up to date.</p>

<p>These examples are available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/" title="">Creative Commons</a> licence. Their source code is available too. If you are willing to do the work needed to make them current, do not hesitate to write.</p>

<p>The <a href="../examples/laudes/laudes.pdf" title="">first example</a>, the smallest, is a chant sung during Adoration (<a href="../examples/laudes/laudes.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="../examples/complies/complies.pdf" title="">second</a> does not contain scores. It is the Benedictine office of Compline in latin, with the French translation (<a href="../examples/complies/complies.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="../examples/bendedictiones/benedictionessmall.pdf" title="">third</a> is a small sheet for guests in monasteries to remember the blessings at meals (<a href="../examples/benedictiones/benedictiones-small.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>And the <a href="../examples/benedictiones/benedictiones.pdf" title="">fourth</a> is the entire book of the blessing of meals in the monastery in Norcia, entirely in Latin. It is very complete and contains a lot of scores (<a href="../examples/benedictiones/benedictiones.zip" title="">sources</a>).</p>

<p>As you can see, it is possible to obtain professional results with <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> and Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>. None of these scores (the gabc file) has taken me more than 3 minutes (with the debug) to write, so Gregorio is really a fast software to use.</p>
