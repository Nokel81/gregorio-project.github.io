<h1>Using syllabifier.py with <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop</h1>

<p>If you’ve ever had to enter a long score in gabc, you’ve probably encountered the special difficulty that this creates.  Since the text and notes are interlaced by syllable in the gabc it’s especially difficult to enter things quickly.  Even for some one well practiced at entering the language of the lyrics, the note sequences don’t follow the usual patterns of the lyrics’ language, so all your stored muscle memory for typing does little to help you enter the notes.  Further, since the lyrics and notes are interlaced on a syllable-by-syllable basis, one’s typing skills (which usually operate at the word level) don’t even help much with the lyrics.  Finally, the interlacing also prevents the use of spell checkers to help make sure that the lyrics have been entered correctly, greatly increasing the amount of proofreading that needs to be done and the chance for mistakes to creep in unnoticed.</p>

<p>One step that can alleviate the latter two of these problems is to enter the lyrics and notes separately.  If the lyrics are entered first (as we suggested in <a href="../tutorial/tutorial-snippet-01.html">snippet tutorial</a>) then one’s typing skills in the language of the lyrics are better employed (increasing the speed of entry) and spell checkers can be used to assist in the proofreading process (reducing the likelihood of mistakes).  The problem is that once the lyrics are entered, they have to be split by syllable, a process which can be cumbersome if done by hand.</p>

<p>Fortunately the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/hyphen-la">hyphen-la</a> project has a <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/hyphen-la/blob/master/syllabifier/syllabify.py">python script</a> which can be used to automate that process.  This script is fairly powerful as is, but deploying it for this purpose can be a bit tricky.  Its input is either a whole file or stdin.  This isn’t very friendly for working over multiple sessions as we have to feed it stuff that contains only lyrics which have not been syllabified yet.  No gabc headers or files which are partially completed.  Sure we can use copy/paste to get around this, but it’s damned inconvenient.  This Tip gets around all that by making the syllabifier available in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop as a macro which will opperate on the selected text.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To make this Tip work, you’ll first need to clone the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/hyphen-la">hyphen-la</a> repository.  For the purposes of our discussion here, we’ll assume that this repository was cloned into <code>~/hyphen-la</code>.  If you cloned it to a different location, then you’ll need to modify the scripts below accordingly.  Once you’ve cloned the repository, run <code>make</code> in the <code>patterns</code> folder (to generate the .dic files that the syllabifier uses).</p>

<p>Further, since <code>syllabifier.py</code> is written in Python 3, you will need an installation of it.  I use MacPorts for that, so I access it with <code>/opt/local/bin/python3</code>.  You can get it from somewhere else if you want, in which case replace <code>/opt/local/bin/python3</code> in the scripts below with the appropriate command for your system.  (Yes, you will need the full path, even if your <code>PATH</code> normally allows you to do without it in Terminal.)</p>

<h2>Accessing syllabifier from the command line</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to make the syllabifier available on the command line.  As I have a personal scripts directory, <code>~/scripts</code> which I’ve already put on my <code>PATH</code>, my first thought was to simply add a symlink in this folder which pointed to the <code>syllabify.py</code>.  While this works for running the script from the command line, it does not work inside of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop.  As a GUI application, the <code>PATH</code> that <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop sees is <code>/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</code> which means that it doesn’t pick-up anything that the user has installed (including both my <code>~/scripts</code> directory and <code>/opt/local/bin</code> where Python 3 is installed).  This limitation is annoying, but Apple claims to do this for security and portability.  Scripts written in this way should run on any Mac (because they cannot use any user customizations) and the tools available to the script writer are highly limited, making it less likely that it can do something dangerous.</p>

<p>Now, it is possible to modify <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop so that it launches with a more complete <code>PATH</code> (we describe how to do so <a href="../introduction-scribus.html#modifymac">for Scribus</a>), but <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop updates frequently enough (several times per year) that I do not want to have to be repeating that process each time.  Instead I’m going to make use of a wrapper script which will use full paths as necessary:</p>

<div class="commandblock">
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env -i bash --noprofile --norc

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

/opt/local/bin/python3 ~/hyphen-la/syllabifier/syllabify.py -c "()" -e
</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, at this point you’re probably wondering about the special shebang in this script.  This shebang basically has the effect of not loading any of the usual customizations to bash and preventing a spawned subshell from inheriting them from the parent shell.  This shebang, therefore, has the effect of making the script function from the command-line in the same way that it will from inside the AppleScript (mostly, there are some subtle differences, but none that affect us here).</p>

<p>The second part of the script is the <code>LANG</code> declaration.  This is one of the environment variables that is not ported over into our limited shell, and without it Python will assume a <code>US-ASCII</code> encoding.  This would result in accented characters not being recognized as letters and that is decidedly not what we want.  By declaring <code>LANG</code> with a <code>UTF-8</code> encoding, I make it so that accented characters are recognized as letters and treated accordingly.</p>

<p>You’ll also notice that I’ve stripped away many of the features of the syllabifier with this script.  It only accepts stdin for input and writes to stdout for output.  It also forces the character which separates the syllables to <code>()</code> (more appropriate for gabc than the default <code>-</code>.  Finally it will always add the hyphen character to the end of each word (assuming you haven’t changed that default).  This makes the script not all that useful outside of the macro we’re going to write.  For those of you interested in a more generally useful wrapper script see <a href="#usefulscript">below</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve written this wrapper script, save it somewhere where you’ll know the full path to it and make it executable (<code>chmod +x /path/to/script</code>).  I saved it to my personal scripts folder as <code>~/scripts/syllabify</code> which is on my <code>PATH</code>.  Even though <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop won’t be able to find this folder automatically, having it on <code>PATH</code> enables one to test it from Terminal: try piping a word into the script: <code>echo puer | syllabify</code>.  If everything is working, you should get <code>pu()er()</code> back out in your Terminal.</p>

<h2>Writing the macro within <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop</code></h2>

<p>Now that our shell script is in place, we write the macro in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop that makes use of it.  To get started fire up <span class=”tex”>T<span class=”epsilon”>e</span>X</span>Shop and open the macro editor (Macros → Open Macro Editor…). Now click on the “New Item” button.  An item titled “New Item” will appear at the bottom of the list and will be selected for you.  Change the name to something more indicative of the macro’s purpose (I chose “Syllabifier”) and then copy the following code into the Content box:</p>

<div class="commandblock">
<pre>
--applescript direct

set docname to #DOCUMENTNAME#

tell application "TeXShop"
	set input to content of selection of document docname
end tell

try
	set output to do shell script ("echo \"" &amp; input &amp; "\" | ~/scripts/syllabify")
on error errStr number errnum
	display dialog "syllabify returned error number " &amp; errnum &amp; "
" &amp; errStr
end try

tell application "TeXShop"
	set content of selection of document docname to output
end tell
</pre>
</div>

<p>For those interested in knowing what the code does, I’ll explain it below.  For those who blindly trust me, you can click Save and are ready to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first line of this macro tells <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop the macro is written in AppleScript and it requires no user interaction while running (the <code>direct</code> part of the line).</li>

<li>The second uses the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop magic variable <code>#DOCUMENTNAME#</code> to set the value of an AppleScript variable (<code>docname</code>) so that we can easily refer to the document we’re working on when the macro is called.</li>

<li>We then have a <code>tell</code> block which asks <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop for the selected text of the current document and stores that in the variable <code>input</code>.</li>

<li>This is followed up by a <code>try</code> block which pipes the selected text (<code>input</code>) into our shell script and stores the output in the variable called <code>output</code>.  In the event of an error, a pop-up window with the error number and message will appear to let you know what went wrong.</li>

<li>Finally, we have another <code>tell</code> block which tells <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop to replace the current selection of the current document with the <code>output</code> from our script.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once saved, you’ll have a new entry in the Macros menu: Syllabifier.  Highlight any text in your document and then run the macro and the <code>()</code> will be put in between the syllables (and after each word) ready for you to start entering notes.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>What should you do if you get an error?  Well, that obviously depends on the error, but the first step should be to check your paths.  Where is <code>syllabify.py</code>?  Is that directory the target of the <code>cd</code> statement in the bash script?  Where is <code>python3</code>?  (You can check this location with <code>which python3</code> in Terminal.)  Is that full path being used in the bash script?  Finally, where did you save the bash script?  Is that the path specified in the AppleScript?  The fact that these paths have to be exactly right and will often vary from computer to computer is the reason this page is here instead of there being a couple of files in the <code>contrib/TeXShop</code> folder of Gregorio.  Double check them all and make sure they match the setup of your computer (which may be different from mine).</p>

<h3 id="usefulscript">The more useful script</h3>

<p>Even though most of what I use the syllabifier for is documents that I work on from within <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop, there are occasions where I want to use it from the command line.  To make that possible I do two things:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I replace the final line in the wrapper script with the following: 
		<div class="commandblock">
		<pre>
/opt/local/bin/python3 ~/Documents/Programming/hyphen-la/syllabifier/syllabify.py $@
		</pre>
		</div>
	This won’t force any options and will pass any command line arguments to the script allowing me to change things as needed when I’m doing command line work.
	</li>
	<li>I make use of the fact that the syllabifier allows me to set my own defaults and set those to be the ones that I want in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop.  To do that I simply invoke <code>syllabify -c "()" -e -d</code> on the command line so that my default hyphen character is “()” and the end of word markers are on by default.  If you can’t set defaults (<i>i.e.</i> you cannot write to the folder where syllabify.py lives) then you’ll need to put these options into AppleScript by editting the shell script it executes to be
			<div class="commandblock">
			<pre>
("echo \"" &amp; input &amp; "\" | ~/scripts/syllabify -c\"()\" -e")
			</pre>
			</div>	
	</li>
</ol>
