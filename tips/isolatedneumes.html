<h1>Isolated Neumes in Text</h1>

<p>When writing academic or instructional works about Gregorian chant, you might want to print a neume directly in the text, rather than breaking into a complete score, in order to better illustrate what you are talking about.  Fortunately, there are two ways to bring those neumes into your text, depending on whether you want a single or multiple glyphs (for a definiton of what Gregorio considers a neume and what it considers a glyph, see <a href="../structure.html">the structure page</a>).</p>

<p><b>Nota Bene:</b> If you want to change the size of the neumes inserted by either of these two methods, then you need to use `\grechangestaffsize`.  When loaded the font containing the musical glyphs is sized to match the current staff size and this is a relationship which it is essential you preserve, otherwise your scores will come out weird.  Fortunately, both these methods are insisitive to the usual <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> size changing commands, but if you're using something else to change font sizes, do not let it mess with the fonts loaded by Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>.</p>

<h3>Single Glyphs</h3>

<p>The first method works best if you neume consists of a single glyph of 5 or fewer notes and for which you know the name of the glyph you want (there is a handy table of glyphs at the end of GregorioRef where you can look up the names).  In this case add the following macro definition to your preamble:</p>

<div class="commandblock">
<pre>
\makeatletter
\def\gretextglyph#1{{\gre@font@music\csname GreCP#1\endcsname}}
\makeatother
</pre>
</div>

<p>This command can then be used to insert the desired glyph anywhere in your text.  For instance a quilisma is inserted as <code>\gretextglyph{Quilisma}</code>.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the glyph you want in the table at the back of GregorioRef, then it is probably a fused glyph: <i>i.e.</i>, a glyph made by fusing two other glyphs together in a seamless fashion.  All glyphs of 6 or more notes are made this way, as are some smaller ones.  In this case you'll want to use the multiple glyph method below.</p>

<h3>Multiple Glyphs</h3>

<p>The second method is to employ a modified form of another trick: <a href="./shortscore.html">the short score</a>.  As a result, it is capable of entring any neume which can be reprsented in gabc regardless of the number of glyphs which go into it.  As a bonus, you don't need to know (or look up) the names of the glyphs you want.</p>

<p>The basic form of the trick is to put a <code>\gabcsnippet</code> inside a <code>minipage</code> (in which we've turned "off" those score elements we don't want to see) and then put that minipage inside a <code>\raisebox</code> so that we can control its position:</p>

<div class="commandblock">
<pre>
\raisebox{0pt}[\height][\depth]{%
    \begin{minipage}{0.8cm}%
        \gresetlines{invisible}%
        \gresetclef{invisible}%
        \greseteolcustos{manual}%
	    \gabcsnippet{(fvEDC)}%
    \end{minipage}%
}%
</pre>
</div>

<p>The above block can be placed in your text exactly where you want it, or can be placed inside a macro definition in the preamble as you prefer.</p>

<p><b>Nota Bene:</b> There are four distances in the above code block which you will have to tune for each neume that you insert:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The first (<code>0pt</code> in the above) is the "raise" of the box, <i>i.e.</i>, it is used to regulate how the neume aligns vertically with the text of the line it is on.</li>
    <li>The second (<code>\height</code> in the above) is how tall <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> should consider the neume, <i>i.e.</i>, it is used to adjust the spacing between the line the neume is on and the line above it.  <code>\height</code> in this case represents the "natural" height of the box contents (which should normally correspond to the height of your neume).</li>
    <li>The third distance (<code>\depth</code> in the above) is how far below the base line <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> should consider the neume to go (the depth), <i>i.e.</i>, it is used to adjust the spacing between the line the neume is on and the line below it.  <code>\depth</code> in this case reprsenents the "natural" depth of the box contents (which should normally be 0).</li>
    <li>The fourth distance (<code>0.8cm</code> in the above) is the width of the box containing the neume.  You should pick it to be as tight to the neume as possible without causing a line break.</li>
</ol>
