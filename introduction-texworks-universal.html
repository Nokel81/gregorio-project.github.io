<p>This page describes how to configure gregorio for use with TeXworks on a Linux box.  You will have to repeat this process for each user who uses TeXworks.</p>

<h3>Configure TeXworks</h3>

<p>While your screens may look a little different depending on your operating system, the steps to configure TeXworks are the same whether you're on Linux, Mac, or Windows.</p>

<p>All we need to do is add the compilation engine for LuaLatex to TeXworks. To do so, go in <code>Edit -&gt; Preferences</code>(<code>TeXworks -&gt; Preferences</code> on a Mac) and then in the "Typesetting" tab, in the "Processing tools" section, click on add ("<code>+</code>"), and enter the following data:</p>

<br />Adding LuaLaTex in TeXworks
</div>

<p>If you want, you can also add LilyPond-Book in a similar fashion (the "--shell-escape" argument is not necessary), though you'll first need to get the engine from <a href="https://sole.dimi.uniud.it/~nicola.vitacolonna/software/lilypond-texshop/">its maker</a>.</p>

<p>Once you've downloaded the engine, open TeXworks and click on <code>Help -&gt; Settings and Resources...</code>  Follow the link to the Resources folder in the pop-up dialog that appears.  In this folder create a new subfolder called "engines" and copy it there.  <b>Note:</b> This engine does not work on Windows.</p>


<p>If everything goes as planned, then you're ready to <a href="/gregorio/introduction-texworks.en.html">start working with TeXworks</a>.  If not, see below.</p>

<h3 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>The most common problem to run into at this stage is for TeXworks to return the following error when you try to add an engine:</p>

<div class="legende">

<br />Problem!
</div>

<p>This problem occurs because some systems automaticaly restrict you from running downloaded files as a saftey precaution.  To let your system know that it's okay to run this file we have to set the executable bit.</p>

<p>To do this start by opening Terminal (it's in <code>Applications/Utilities</code>) then enter the following commands (you can leave out the lines associated with engines you're not setting up):</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>cd ~/.TeXworks/engines</code><br />
<code>chmod a+x gregorio.engine</code><br />
<code>chmod a+x greg-book.engine</code><br />
<code>chmod a+x greg-lily-book.engine</code><br />
<code>chmod a+x LilyPond-Book.engine</code>
</div>

<p>Once you've done this, you should be able to add the engines to TeXworks as described above.</p>

<p>If you're still having trouble, then sign up for the users mailing list (<a href="/gregorio/contact">instructions are here</a>) and send an email describing your problem in as much detail as possible.  Someone will help you get your issue resolved.</p>
