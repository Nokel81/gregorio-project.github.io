<h1>History of the Gregorio project</h1>

<p>The Gregorio project was born in 2006 at <a href="http://www.telecom-bretagne.eu" title="TELECOM Bretagne">TELECOM Bretagne</a>, a graduate engineering school in France. It was at first a student project of six months duration, supervised by <a href="http://www.telecom-bretagne.eu/studies/msc/professors/haralambous/" >Mr Yannis Haralambous</a>, developer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_(TeX)" title="Wikipedia article about Omega">Omega</a>. When the project was done, Élie Roux decided to continue the project on his own and to develop it under GPL.</p>

<p>From the outset the goal of the project has been to create a graphical interface for the monks of the <a href="http://www.barroux.org/" title="Site of the abbey">Abbey of Sainte Madeleine du Barroux</a> so that they could use a gregorian font. This font, <a href="http://anatoletype.net/projects/gregoria" title="Presentation of the font Gregoria"><em>Gregoria</em></a>, is a professional font designed by Elena Albertoni, a typographer and graphic designer. Finally, due to licence issues, it was decided that the project would have its own font called <em>gregorio</em>.</p>

<p>At the end of the year 2006, a new developer, Olivier Berten, joined the project and created its OpusTeX component (deprecated since). By April 2007, Gregorio had reached a certain maturity and could start to be used, at least through its command line interface, as a preprocessor for OpusTeX. A <a href="https://gna.org/projects/gregorio/" title="Page of the Gregorio project on Gna!">project page</a> was created at gna.org (now superceded by this site).</p>

<p>The development of the graphical interface and the modification of the code structure to use autotools and dynamic libraries was the subject of Élie's third-year project at TELECOM Bretagne. The graphical interface proved to be too complex and was never finished.</p>

<p>During a three-month internship starting in April 2008 at the <a href="http://osbnorcia.org">Monastero di San Benedetto</a>, in Norcia (Italy), Gregorio made considerable progress. The GregorioTeX package was almost finished, and as a consequence, we made progress in code stabilization.</p>

<p>As of 2015, three major versions of the Gregorio software have been released.</p>
