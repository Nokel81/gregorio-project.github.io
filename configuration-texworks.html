<h1>Configuring TeXworks for Gregorio</h1>

<h3>Automatic score compilation</h3>

<p>A feature of Gregorio version 3.0 and later is the automatic compilation of gabc scores when needed to complete a LaTeX document.  For this feature to work, <code>lualatex</code> must be able to launch the <code>gregorio</code> program during compilation.</p>

<p>TeXworks can be configured to do this by creating a new engine for compilation that adds the <code>--shell-escape</code> argument to <code>lualatex</code>.</p>

<p>To create it, go into <code>Edit -&gt; Preferences</code> (into <code>TeXworks -&gt; Preferences</code> on a Mac).  Then, in the "Typesetting" tab, in the "Processing tools" section, click on "+" in the "Tools" section. You can fill the values for the new engine:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>Name: LuaLaTeX+se</code><br>
<code>Program: lualatex</code><br>
</div>

<p>The name <code>LuaLaTeX+se</code> is arbitrary, but it's important to use it so that Gregorio users will be able to share scores.</p>

<p>Then you need to add three arguments, clicking each time on "+": first is <code>--shell-escape</code>, second is <code>$synctexoption</code>, third is <code>$fullname</code>.

<p>Once you're done, validate everything and restart TeXworks.</p>

<h3>Ease of use of .gabc files (optional)</h3>

<p>If you want to be able to filter files with <code>.gabc</code> extensions in the file dialogs of TeXworks, you have to hack the configuration files a little, but this is very easy.</p>

<p>First, you have to find the file named <code>texworks-config.txt</code>. Under Linux it is in <code>~/.TeXworks/configuration/</code>, under Windows it should be in <code>C:/Users/&lt;your user name&gt;/.texlive2015/texmf-config</code> (replace "2015" with your version); if it's not there, you can look for it with the Windows search tools.</p>

<p>Then open this file, and, near the end, you will see comments starting by <code># file-open-filter:</code>. Simply add the following line:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code># file-open-filter: Gabc score (*.gabc)</code>
</div>

<p>...where you want it to appear in the list.</p>

<h3>Using TeXworks</h3>

<p>Once TeXworks is ready, refer to <a href="introduction-editor.html">the introduction page</a> to start using Gregorio!</p>
