<h1>Configuring <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works for Gregorio</h1>

<h3>Automatic score compilation</h3>

<p>A feature of Gregorio version 3.0 and later is the automatic compilation of gabc scores when needed to complete a <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> document.  For this feature to work, <code>lualatex</code> must be able to launch the <code>gregorio</code> program during compilation.</p>

<p><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works can be configured to do this by creating a new engine for compilation that adds the <code>--shell-escape</code> argument to <code>lualatex</code>.</p>

<p>To create it, go into <code>Edit -&gt; Preferences</code> (into <code>TeXworks -&gt; Preferences</code> on a Mac).  Then, in the "Typesetting" tab, in the "Processing tools" section, click on "+" in the "Tools" section. You can fill the values for the new engine:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>Name: LuaLaTeX+se</code><br>
<code>Program: lualatex</code><br>
</div>

<p>The name <code>LuaLaTeX+se</code> is arbitrary, but it's important to use it so that Gregorio users will be able to share scores.</p>

<p>Then you need to add three arguments, clicking each time on "+": first is <code>--shell-escape</code>, second is <code>$synctexoption</code>, third is <code>$fullname</code>.</p>

<p>Once you're done, validate everything and restart <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works.</p>

<h3>Ease of use of .gabc files (optional)</h3>

<p>If you want to be able to filter files with <code>.gabc</code> extensions in the file dialogs of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works, you have to hack the configuration files a little, but this is very easy.</p>

<p>First, you have to find the file named <code>texworks-config.txt</code>. Under Linux it is in <code>~/.TeXworks/configuration/</code>, under Mac it is in <code>~/Library/TeXworks/configuration/</code>, under Windows it should be in <code>C:/Users/&lt;your user name&gt;/.texlive2015/texmf-config</code> (replace "2015" with your version); if it's not there, you can look for it with the Windows search tools.  On some systems, this file may be designated as read-only.  If it is, you'll need to alter its permissions before proceeding.</p>

<p><b>Nota Bene:</b> If you have never opened <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works before then the configuration files will not exist on your system.  Open and close <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works and it will create the missing configuration files.  You can also reset your configuration to the default by simply deleting all the configuration files and then opening and closing <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works.</p>

<p>Then open this file, and, near the end, you will see comments starting by <code># file-open-filter:</code>. Uncomment these lines (delete the leading "<code># </code>", note that the space has to go too) and then add the following line:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>file-open-filter: Gabc score (*.gabc)</code>
</div>

<p>...where you want it to appear in the list.</p>

<p>You might also want to add the a line to cleanup patterns section:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>cleanup-patterns: $jobname.gaux *-*_*_*.gtex</code>
</div>

<p>Doing this will allow the "Remove Aux Files" command to remove the intermediate files generated by Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> along with all the other files it removes.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The interesting combination of wildcards (<code>*</code>) and characters on the <code>gtex</code> filename is designed to pickup the automaticly created <code>gtex</code> files which have the version number attached to the original filename in the form <code>-4_0_0</code> (though with the numbers of the Gregorio version currently installed).  However, if you are in the habit of using dashes and underscores in your filenames, then it may pickup files you've generated manually, so caution is advised.</p>

<h3>Using <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works</h3>

<p>Once <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works is ready, refer to <a href="introduction-editor.html">the introduction page</a> to start using Gregorio!</p>
