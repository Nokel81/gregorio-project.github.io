<h1>Gregorio and GABC Tutorial</h1>

<p>This tutorial demonstrates the features of Gregorio by showing how to reproduce an existing score.</p>

<p>Documentation for the gabc notation which we use in this tutorial can be found <a href="../gabc/index.html">here</a>. A <a href="../gabc/summary-gabc.pdf">one-page summary is also on-line</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>If you plan on following along with the tutorial, you'll need to <a href="../introduction.html">choose your method</a> for using Gregorio and set your system up first.</p>

<p>We'll start with an empty staff and build up from there. Along the way, I'll make some deliberate mistakes to illustrate some common problems.</p>

<p>If you don't have Gregorio installed on your own computer, you can find out about running it through the web at this <a href="../introduction-web.html"> introduction page</a>.</p>

<h2>Kyrie XVII</h2>

<p>Here is a score from the <i>Liber Cantualis</i>. </p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-xvii-goal.png"/>
</div>

<h3>Step one: Enter the first syllable.</h3>

<p>To start creating a gabc file, I'll enter the name of the piece, indicate the clef position, and specify the note for the first syllable.</p>

<div class="commandblock">
<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)
</pre>
</div>

<p>Save this file as <code>kyrie.gabc</code>.</p>

<p><b>Nota Bene:</b> If you want to choose a different file name for this, or any other file, it is absolutely essential that you do not includes spaces in the file name.  <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> will throw a hissy fit if you do, because it uses spaces to determine where arguments end.</p>

<p>Now, while the gabc file represents the musical content of your score, it is not a format which <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> understands.  Thus we need to create another document which <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> does understand and which will direct Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> (the package which tells <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> how to find the musical content.</p>

<p>To do this, open a new document and enter the following content:</p>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
\documentclass[12pt, a5paper]{article}

\usepackage{fullpage}

\usepackage{newcent}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\usepackage[autocompile]{gregoriotex}

\begin{document}

\gregorioscore{kyrie}

\end{document}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Save this file as <code>kyrie.tex</code> in the same folder as you saved <code>kyrie.gabc</code> and then compile the document with Lua<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>.</p>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-01.png"/>
</div>

<p>Well, it's not much, but it's a start.  The note on "Ky" is on the second line, and that's represented by (f).  Gregorio automatically makes the first letter of the piece a large initial.</p>

<p>Let's add some more text and notes:</p>

<h3>Adding notes</h3>


<div class="commandblock">
<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)<font color="red">ri(gfg)e(h)</font>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-02.png"/>
</div>

<p>That looks better. The three notes on "ri" are represented by (gfg).  Let's add more notes.  Here's a reminder of the letters used to represent each note position on the staff:</p>

<img src="note-positions.png"/>

<h3>Adding more notes</h3>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)ri(gfg)e(h) <font color="red">* e(jihghfe)le(ghg)i(g)son(f).</font>
	</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, if you try to typeset this document, you're going to get an error indicating there's a problem in <code>kyrie.gabc</code>.  We're going to fix this error later, so for now (and for the next few steps) simply instruct <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> to ignore the error.  After it finishes the typesetting process (without producing a pdf), typeset the document again and you won't get the error, but will get the pdf file.</p>


<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-03.png"/>
</div>

<p>The Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> system certainly produced some beautiful neumes automatically, but they don't match the original, because we didn't specify the neume shapes we wanted. To produce the diamond-shaped ("inclined") notes that we want, we'll type them in upper-case.</p>

<h3>Using capital letters to represent "inclined" notes</h3>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)ri(gfg)e(h) * e(j<font color="red">IHG</font>h<font color="red">FE</font>)le(ghg)i(g)son(f).
	</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-04.png"/>
</div>

<p>Now we have the right "inclined" notes.   Here's another change we should make: each series of inclined notes is preceded by a <i>virga</i> instead of a simple punctum.  A virga is a punctum with a stem attached.    Let's change those note shapes by adding a "v" after the note letters.</p>

<h3>Marking virgas with "v"</h3>

<p>In the previous step's gabc file, the notes on the first syllable of <i>eleison</i> are <code>(jIHGhFEi)</code>.  Because the "j" note and the "h" note should both be virgas, change them to "jv" and "hv":</p>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)ri(gfg)e(h) * e(<font color="red">jv</font>IHG<font color="red">hv</font>FE)le(ghg)i(g)son(f). bis
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-05.png"/>
</div>

<h3>Time for a review!</h3>

<p>Let's compare this with the original to see what else needs to be corrected:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-xvii-goal.png"/>
</div>

<p>We need to add the flat symbol, mark the dots on the <i>punctum mora</i> notes, indicate the ictuses, and add the double bar.   Also, we need to fix up some details about the text, but we'll do that after correcting the notes.</p>

<h3>Adding marks for <i>punctum mora</i> and ictus</h3>

<p>Each <i>punctum mora</i> is represented with a period after the note letter, and each ictus is represented with an apostrophe after the note letter.   Because a vertical episema looks identical to an ictus mark, we would treat them the same way.</p>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)ri(gfg)e(<font color="red">h.</font>) * e(jvI<font color="red">H'</font>Hhv<font color="red">F'</font>es)le(gh<font color="red">g'</font>)i(g)son(<font color="red">f.</font>).
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-06.png"/>
</div>

<h3>Adding the flat and the double bar</h3>

<p>In gabc notation, "x" represents a flat symbol.  Because the flat falls on position "i" (the uppermost space in the staff), we represent it with the letters "ix", and we add those letters to the first syllable of <i>eleison</i>.<p>

<p>After <i>eleison</i>, let us add the word <i>bis</i>, meaning 'twice', since the phrase is to be sung twice.  The double bar is represented with a double colon (::), on the word "bis".   Let's also take the moment to set "bis" in italic type.</p>


<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)ri(gfg)e(h.) * e(<font color="red">ix</font>jvIH'GhvF'E)le(ghg')i(g)son(f.). <font color="red">&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(::)</font>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-07.png"/>
</div>

<h3>Correcting two text alignment problems</h3>

<p>You've probably noticed that a syntax error was reported during processing of some of the above steps.   That happened because the text <i>Kyrie eleison</i> ends with a period, but the notes for "-son" were put before the period:</p>
<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
e(ixjvIH'GhvF'E)le(ghg')i(g)son(f.). 
</pre>
</div>

<p>Even in the result from the previous step, where the error has disappeared, there's a hyphen over the period.  Let's move the period and put it next to the syllable, like this: "son." and resolve that issue.</p>

<p>Also, you may have noticed that there are notes above the asterisk, unlike in the original score.  We do not want any notes above the asterisk; therefore, to express that intention, let's add a pair of empty parentheses () at the asterisk.</p>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)Ky(f)ri(gfg)e(h.) <font color="red">*()</font> e(ixjvIH'GhvF'E)le(ghg')i(g)<font color="red">son.</font>(f.) &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(::)
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-08.png"/>
</div>

<h3>Text correction</h3>

<p>In the original score, the "y" in <i>Kyrie</i> is capitalized.  This is a convention in typesetting for chant scores, so let's follow it here, by changing the "y" to an upper-case letter.</p>

<p><b>Nota Bene:</b> More advanced users may want to handle the capitalizing of the "y" using the <code>firstsyllable</code> and <code>firstsyllableinitial</code> styles from within the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> file.  For information on how to do this, consult the Styling section of GregorioRef-###.pdf (where ### is the version number).</p>

<p>Also, the word <i>eleison</i> needs an accent mark on the second "e", so I'm going to replace that letter with the character "&eacute;". If your keyboard layout does not have the "&eacute;" character, you can probably produce it by using your operating system's "Character Select" utility.  Copy the desired character to the clipboard, and paste it into your gabc file.</p>

<div class="commandblock">
	<pre>
name:Kyrie XVII;
%%
(c4)K<font color="red">Y</font>(f)ri(gfg)e(h.) *() e(ixjvIH'GhvF'E)l<font color="red">&eacute;</font>(ghg')i(g)son.(f.) &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(::)
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here's the result after processing by gregorio and <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-17-09.png"/>
</div>

<h3>Pretty good progress!</h3>

<p>Let's compare this with the original again:</p>

<div class="legende">
<img src="kyrie-xvii-goal.png"/>
</div>

<p>There are still some differences.  Of course, the typefaces are different. The examples above from my system use the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> typeface "newcent" (New Century Schoolbook), which is very readable. I'll do an experiment with a different typeface later.</p>

<p>There is also a difference in the hyphenation of the text. The gregorio software did not automatically add a hyphen after the first syllable of <i>KYrie</i>, because there was enough space between the neumes without a hyphen. Feel free to add a hyphen manually in your gabc file if you find that it makes the score more readable for you.</p>

<p>Let's go on to <a href="./tutorial-gabc-02.html">another page</a>, to continue work on this Kyrie.</p>
