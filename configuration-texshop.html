<h1>Configuring TeXShop for Gregorio</h1>

<h3>Automatic score compilation</h3>

<p>Gregorio needs a <code>lualatex</code> engine that is able to launch the <code>gregorio</code> program during compilation in order to compile gabc scores automatically (i.e. the engine has to have the <code>--shell-escape</code> option active).  Unfortunately, TeXShop does not come with such an engine configured by default.</p>

<p>To make life easier, we've included an engine which is set up correctly, in the contributed add-ons which were installed as part of Gregorio: <code>LuaLaTeX+se.engine</code>.  You can find it in <code>/Users/Shared/Gregorio/contrib/TeXShop</code> if you used the installer or in <code>#/gregorio-git/contrib/TeXShop</code> if you cloned the repository (where <code>#</code> is the directory you cloned the repository to).  Simply copy this file to <code>~/Library/TeXShop/Engines</code> and the engine should show up in the drop down list the next time you start TeXShop.</p>

<p>The name <code>LuaLaTeX+se</code> is arbitrary, but it's important to use it, so that everyone can have the same scores.  This will also serve to differentiate it from the normal LuaLaTeX engine where the shell escape option is not active (TeXShop comes with this engine in its Inactive folder).</p>

<h3>Ease of use of .gabc files (optional)</h3>

<p>If you want to be able to filter files with <code>.gabc</code> extensions in the file dialogs of TeXShop, open a Terminal window (it's in <code>Applications/Utilities</code>) and enter the following command:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>defaults write TeXShop OtherTeXExtensions -array-add "gabc"</code>
</div>

<h3>Using TeXShop</h3>

<p>Once TeXShop is ready, refer to <a href="introduction-editor.html">the introduction page</a> to start using Gregorio!</p>
