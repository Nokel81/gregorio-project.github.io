<h1>Installing Gregorio under Mac OSX</h1>

<h2>The TeX distribution</h2>

<p>The first step to make Gregorio work is to have a TeX distribution: MacTeX or TeXLive. See the <a href="http://tug.org/mactex/">official site</a> for instructions.</p>

<h2>The installer</h2>

<p>An installer has been created for some Mac systems. It is available from the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases">download page</a>, meant for systems running OS X versions 10.5 or later.</p>

<h2>Compiling from sources</h2>

<h3>Development environment installation</h3>

<p>To be able to compile Gregorio, you must first install an installation environment. Here are the main guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>download XCode (free) from the Apple Mac App Store</li>
<li>lauch it, it will first want to install a device manager, install it</li>
<li>under Preferences, click on Downloads and install the Command Line Tools</li>
<li>download and install <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> (free)</li>
<li>once installed, in the TERMINAL, do <code>sudo port selfupdate</code> to get the latest sources packages</li>
<li>do <code>sudo port install libtool autoconf automake flex bison</code>.</li>
<li>For gregorio versions &lt;4.0, is you are using <span style="font-family: monospace;">--enable-xml-read</span> then this additional dependency is needed: <code>sudo port install libxml2</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once all this is done, you should be able to compile Gregorio.</p>

<p>If you want to compile fonts (to modify them, or when building directly from git), do <code>sudo port install fontforge +python27</code>.</p>

<h3>Source downloading</h3>

<p>You have a choice between versions of Gregorio. To obtain the sources of the stable version, you just need to download the sources from the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases">download page</a>, and decompress the archive.</p>

<p><b>Nota bene:</b> There are three source code files on the download page.  Two have the name "Source Code" (once in zip and one in tar.gz format).  These files are images of the repository at the time of the release which are added automatically by GitHub.  As a result, the process for building from these files is identical to the process for building from a clone of the repository itself.  The other source code file, "gregorio-x.x.x.tar.bz2", is a special distribution version of the source which has several files, which do not depend on your particular system's architecture, pre-built for you.  As a result, it requires fewer tools to build.</p>

<p>To get the git version, that is, the version in development (more functionalities, but might contain more bugs), you will have to create a local copy of the git repository of the project, with the command:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>$ git clone --depth 1 -b develop https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio.git gregorio-git</code>
</div>

<h3>Compilation</h3>

<p>Once the sources are downloaded, carry out the following commands in the directory containing the source files:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>$ ./build.sh --arch=x86_64 --enable-all-static --disable-shared --enable-static-ltdl</code><br/>
<code>$ sudo ./install.sh</code><br/>
</div>

<p><b>Nota bene:</b> Technically speaking, only the first argument is required for <code>build.sh</code>, the others are optional (indeed, in the most recent versions of develop they will be unrecognized as valid options).  However they will reduce the number of files installed on your machine by making the command line tool self contained, rather than using linked libraries. This will make upgrading easier as we are currently reworking the source code to eliminate the linked libraries structure.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>To update your git version, you just need to go into the directory containing the source files (assuming you kept it), run <code>git pull</code> and recompile with the same instructions as the previous <em>Compilation</em> section.  If you deleted that directory after install, then just repeat the steps above starting at the <code>git clone</code> command.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>It can be very helpful to <a href="configuration-texshop.html">configure TeXShop for Gregorio</a>. Once you have done so, refer to the <a href="introduction-editor.html">introduction page</a> to start using Gregorio !</p>
