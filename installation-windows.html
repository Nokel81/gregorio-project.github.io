<h1>Installing Gregorio under Windows</h1>

<p>The first step for a simple install of gregorio under Windows is to install <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live:</p>

<h2>Installing <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live</h2>

<p>To install Gregorio and its <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> package Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, you will first need a complete <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> system (called a <em>distribution</em>). There are various <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> distributions.  The two most prominent for Windows are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mik<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, a distribution exclusively for Windows,</li>
<li><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live, an up-to-date widespread multi-platform distribution,</li>
</ul>

<p>As <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live is the system used on Linux and Mac, we have chosen to describe the installation of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live.  However, the installer will also with MiK<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> should that be your distribution of choice.</p>

<p>To begin, download the latest <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live installer from <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip">the official site</a> and unzip it. Then you have two options:</p>

<p> The first is to launch <code>install-tl.bat</code> and to say yes all the time, it will simply install all the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live distribution (about 3GB).</p>

<p>If you have less time or disk space, launch <code>install-tl-advanced.bat</code>. A graphical interface will open to give you the installation options. Click on the uppermost "Change" button, to select the <code>scheme medium</code>. Click then on the second "Change" button and select at least "Lua<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> packets", "<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>3 packets", "<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> recommended packages", "Recommended standard packages", "Recommended fonts", "<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> base packages" and "Essential programs and files". Click then on the "Change" button for languages. Deselect all the documentation languages (you can find them on the Internet), as well as all the languages on the left that you won't use (latin is not selected by default, so make sure that you do select it for installation). To save some space, you can also say "no" to "Install source of macros and fonts". The space required for installation should be less than 1GB.</p>

<p>Once you have activated the installation choices, click on "Install <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live". The installation may take a while, because it requires downloading the necessary packages.</p>

<h2>Installing Gregorio</h2>

<p>Once you've installed <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live, you have to restart your computer before you can install gregorio. Once you have done that, you can find a Windows auto-installer called <code>gregorio-##-setup.exe</code> (where ## is the version number) available in the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases">Download</a> section for the more recent releases. Simply follow the steps and the installation will be complete!</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>It can be very helpful to <a href="./configuration-texworks.html">configure <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works for Gregorio</a>. Once you have done so, refer to the <a href="./introduction-editor.html">introduction page</a> to start using Gregorio!</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you can't get Gregorio to work after following the above steps, then please <a href="./contact.html">report your problem</a> and we'll try to help you fix it.  In order to make this process go as quickly as possible, please run <code>system-setup.bat</code> and include the contents of the generated log file as part of your report.  You can find <code>system-setup.bat</code> in the destination directory you selected when running the installer, or <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/blob/master/contrib/system-setup.bat">download it directly from GitHub.</a>  Once you've found the file in Windows Explorer, simply double click on the icon to run it.</p>
