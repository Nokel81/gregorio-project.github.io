<h1>Installing Gregorio under Windows</h1>

<p>The first step for a simple install of gregorio under Windows is to install <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live:</p>

<h2>Installing <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live</h2>

<p>To install Gregorio and its <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> package Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, you will first need a complete <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> system (called a <em>distribution</em>). There are various <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> distributions.  The two most prominent for Windows are:</p>

<ul>
<li>MiK<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> </li>
<li><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live</li>
</ul>

<p>As <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live is the system used on Linux and Mac, we have chosen to describe the installation of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live.  However, the installer will also work with MiK<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> should that be your distribution of choice.</p>

<p>To begin, download the latest <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live installer from <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip">the official site</a> and unzip it. Then you have three options:</p>

<p> The first is to launch <code>install-tl.bat</code> and to say yes all the time (though you may want to switch the default paper size to "Letter" if you are in the United States), it will simply install all the <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live distribution (about 4GB).  If you have the space (and the time) we strongly recommend using this option.  Furthermore, in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live 2016 and later, this process will install Gregorio, allowing you to skip the remainder of these instructions (unless you want a more recent version of Gregorio than what shipped with the version of <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live that you are installing).</p>

<p>If you have less time or disk space, launch <code>install-tl-advanced.bat</code>. A graphical interface will open to give you the installation options. Click on the uppermost "Change" button, to select the <code>medium scheme</code>. Click then on the second "Change" button and add "<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> additional packages" to the selections.  In <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live 2016 you can also add "Music packages", as it contains Gregorio, though if you intend to install a more recent version of Gregorio, you can leave that off and just follow the directions below.  To save some space, you can also unselect the languages you don't need (Latin is in the "Other European languages"), "ConTeXt and packages", and "XeTeX and packages". The space required for installation should be about 1.5GB.  If you are in the United States you may also want to toggle the default paper size to "letter".</p>

<p>For a truly minimal installation (as far as Gregorio is concerned), launch <code>install-tl-advanced.bat</code>.  Click on the uppermost "Change" button, to select the <code>basic scheme</code>.  Click then on the second "Change" button and add "LuaTeX packages" (you might also want to add "TeXworks editor" unless you plan to compile documents from the commandline)".  After installation, you will then need to launch <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live Manager and add the following packages: xcolor, luaotfload, and xstring at a minimum.  In <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live 2016 and later you can also use <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live Manager to install Gregorio (look for gregoriotex).  This included package, however, is only updated annually when <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live updates.  For more recent versions of Gregorio you'll need to follow the directions below.  Depending on what you are doing, you may also need to add other packages.  The space required for this installation starts at about 300MB, but may be higher if you require more packages.  If you are in the United States you may also want to toggle the default paper size to "letter".</p>

<p>Once you have activated the installation choices, click on "Install <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live". The installation may take a while, because it requires downloading the necessary packages.</p>

<p>If you are using MiK<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, we recommend that you get a complete installation since it will provide you with the most flexibility going forward, we understand that not everyone has the disk space or time to install the roughly 4GB of material that this requires.  If you are trying to maintain a slimmer installation, you will want to enable the option to download and install needed packages on the fly.  This will make for a slow compilation that requires an internet connection the first time you use Gregorio.  However, it will restrict installation space to just the bare minimum of needed packages.  Like <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live, MiK<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> also has a version of Gregorio included, but one which is only updated anually.</p>

<h2>Installing Gregorio</h2>

<p>Once you've installed <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Live, you have to restart your computer before you can install gregorio. Once you have done that, you can find a Windows auto-installer called <code>gregorio-##-setup.exe</code> (where ## is the version number) available in the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases">Download</a> section for the more recent releases. Simply follow the steps and the installation will be complete!</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>It can be very helpful to <a href="./configuration-texworks.html">configure <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works for Gregorio</a>. Once you have done so, refer to the <a href="./introduction-editor.html">introduction page</a> to start using Gregorio!</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you can't get Gregorio to work after following the above steps, then please <a href="./contact.html">report your problem</a> and we'll try to help you fix it.  In order to make this process go as quickly as possible, please run <code>system-setup.bat</code> and include the contents of the generated log file as part of your report.  You can find <code>system-setup.bat</code> in the destination directory you selected when running the installer, or <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/blob/master/contrib/system-setup.bat">download it directly from GitHub.</a>  Once you've found the file in Windows Explorer, simply double click on the icon to run it.</p>
