<h1><!--#echo var="title" --></h1>

<p>This page is made for advanced Windows users who want to have more control over gregorio, or who want the latest development version.</p>

<p>Compiling gregorio under Windows is unfortunately rather lengthy, as it requires the installation of a Cygwin system and TeXLive, if you do not have any of these already installed.</p>

<h2>Installing Cygwin</h2>

<p>The first step to get gregorio working under Windows is to install Cygwin. Cygwin is an Linux abstraction layer for Windows which contains many useful programs, notably a command-line interface.</p>

<p>To install Cygwin, download the installer on the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">official site</a> and launch it, take all the default options, and choose a mirror site: any of them will suffice, in case you're not familiar with what a mirror site is.  You will arrive at a window for choosing which software you want to install within your cygwin system. You will need the following supplementary software packages: flex, bison, gcc, cvs, gcc4, make, automake, autoconf, libtool, python, libxml2, libxml2-dev, gettext, gettext-dev, pkg-config.</p>

<p><strong>/!\ Warning!!!</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> install tetex, tetex-base, tetex-bin, tetex-extra nor TeXMacs, or you won't be able to use TeXLive, which is mandatory for gregorio!</p>

<p>Once you have made your choice of software, go on to the installation proper. Downloading the packages may take a little time. When that is done, you can launch <code>Cygwin.exe</code>, which will open a command-line terminal. To start a more convenient graphical interface, just type <code>startx</code> in that terminal.</p>

<p>You can use a command-line terminal to familiarise yourself with the Linux shell commands. If this is your first such experience, refer to the numerous tutorials on this subject which are on the net.  You can find an appropriate tutorial by searching with Google, with the keywords  <code>tutorial shell linux</code>.</p>

<h2>Installing TeXLive</h2>

<p>To use GregorioTeX, the TeX system of gregorio, you will need a complete TeX system (called a <em>distribution</em>). There are various TeX distributions for Windows.  The most common are:</p>

<ul>
<li>MikTeX, a distribution exclusively for Windows,</li>
<li>TeTeX, a multi-platform distribution containing Aleph but not LuaTeX, and no longer maintained,</li>
<li>TeXLive, an up-to-date widespread multi-platform distribution,</li>
</ul>

<p>As TeXLive is the system used on Linux and Mac, we have chosen to describe the installation of TeXLive. Everything should work the same with MikTeX but it has not been tested.</p>

<p>To begin, download the latest TeXLive installer from <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip">the official site</a> and unzip it. Then you have two options:</p>

<p> The first is to launch <code>install-tl.bat</code> and to say yes all the time, it will simply install all the TeXLive distribution (about 3GB).</p>

<p>If you have less time or disk space, launch <code>install-tl-advanced.bat</code>. A graphical interface will open to give you the installation options. Click on the uppermost "Change" button, to select the <code>scheme medium</code>. Click then on the second "Change" button and select at least "LuaTeX packets", "LaTeX3 packets", "LaTeX recommended packages", "Recommended standard packages", "Recommended fonts", "LaTeX base packages" and "Essential programs and files". Click then on the "Change" button for languages. Deselect all the documentation languages (you can find them on the Internet), as well as all the languages on the left that you won't use (don't forget to check latin, which is unchecked by default). To gain some room, you can also say "no" to "Install source of macros and fonts". It should be less than 1GB.</p>

<p>Once you have activated the installation choices, click on "Install TeXLive". The installation may take a while, because it requires downloading the necessary packages.</p>

<h2>Compiling Gregorio</h2>

<p>Compiling Gregorio is very easy under windows, if you have the good dependencies (see above on this page), you just have to compile like on any other civilized system. First download the source tarball from the <a href="http://download.gna.org/gregorio/releases/current">download page</a> or clone the git reposity, and save it in your Cygwin home directory, typically <code>C:\\cygwin\home\foo</code>, where <code>foo</code> is your Windows username.</p>

<p>Then launch Cygwin and, if you have downloaded the sources, uncompress the gregorio archive:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>tar xzf gregorio-*.tar.gz</code>
</div>

<p>Enter the <code>gregorio</code> directory with the command:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>cd gregorio-*</code>
</div>

<p>And finally compile and install with the commands:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>$ ./configure --prefix=/usr</code><br/>
<code>$ make</code><br/>
<code>$ make install</code><br/>
<code>$ cd fonts</code><br/>
<code>$ make install</code><br/>
<code>$ texhash</code>
</div>
