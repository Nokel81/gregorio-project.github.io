<h1>Using Gregorio with Scribus</h1>

<p>This page describes the use of Gregorio within <a href="http://www.scribus.net/" title="">Scribus</a>.</p>

<h3>Scribus</h3>

<p>Scribus is a free <acronym title="Desktop Publishing">DTP</acronym> (desktop publishing) software with a simple and accessible graphical user interface. It is possible to include Gregorio scores in a Scribus document, and thus to build a book or a booklet containing Gregorian scores simply.</p>

<h3>Installing the additional Scribus files</h3>

<p>To be able to use Gregorio in Scribus, some additional files for Scribus must be installed. These files are available in the <code>contrib/</code> directory of the Gregorio sources, and also in the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/tree/master/contrib">Git repository</a>. These files are <code>900_gregorio.xml</code> and <code>gregorio.png</code>. If you are under Windows, they are in <code>C:\Program Files\Gregorio\contrib</code> (assuming you have gregorio installed here).</p>

<p class="nofirst">If you are under MacOS X or if you have installed Gregorio under Windows with the advanced method, you will need to slightly modify these files to adapt them to your system. These modifications are described in the comments of the file <code>900_gregorio.xml</code>.</p>

<p class="nofirst">Finally, you need to make Scribus use these files. In the Scribus menu, go to  <code>File/Preferences</code>. Then, in the <code>External Tools</code> part, under <code>Render Frames</code>, click on <code>Add</code> and select the file <code>900_gregorio.xml</code>. Something you might want to do is to make gregorio the first item of the list. To do so, click on <code>Up</code> several times. Click on <code>Apply</code>, then <code>OK</code>, and you're done.</p>

<h3>Use in Scribus</h3>

<p>The use of gregorio inside Scribus is almost the same as the use of <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> within Scribus: click on <code>Insert/Insert Render Frame</code>, then select the area in which you want a score to appear. Right-click on this area and click on <code>Edit Source</code>, and the editor will open.</p>

<p class="nofirst">First select gregorio in the program list (if it's not selected by default). The left text area allows you to enter the gabc code of the score. Two other tabs are present: one to add some packages to the <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> header, and one to enter some Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> commands.</p>

<p class="nofirst">The rendering result may look strange at first, because the preview has a low quality; this is not the case for the final rendering; which you will see if you export in PDF.</p>

<p class="nofirst">When you try to export a PDF, you will need to check the box <code>Embed EPS &amp; PDF files (EXPERIMENTAL)</code>. While exporting, Scribus will output some warnings, but you can ignore them safely.  If you cannot check that box (this happens in certain versions, especially under Linux), the scores will be included as images, which can introduce pixelization. To improve the quality of the images, you can change the value of the option <code>Resolution for EPS Graphics</code>; 600dpi is a standard value for desktop printers. Note that in this case the size of the PDF output file will be as much as 10 times greater.</p>
