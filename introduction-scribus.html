<h1><!--#echo var="title" --></h1>

<p>This page describes the use of gregorio inside the free <acronym title="Desktop Publishing">DTP</acronym> software called <a href="http://www.scribus.net/" title="">Scribus</a>. This possibility works from version 1.0 of gregorio and version 1.3.5 of Scribus.</p>

<h3>Scribus</h3>

<p>Scribus is a free <acronym title="Desktop Publishing">DTP</acronym> software that has this advantage to have a simple and accessible graphical user interface. It is possible to include gregorio scores in a Scribus document, and thus to build simply a book or a booklet containing gregorian scores.</p>

<p class="nofirst">A page describing the process to have the latest version of gregorio under Linux is available on the <a href="http://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=fr&page=install1">Scribus web site</a>. The Windows version is available on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus-devel/">download page</a> and the instructions for Mac <a href="http://www.scribus.net/?q=macosx">here</a>. Note that in order for the gregorio score import to work, you also need ghostscript, certainly already installed under Linux, and available for Windows on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/files/GPL%20Ghostscript/8.70">sourceforge page</a>.</p>

<p class="nofirst">If you encounter problems with the Scribus software outside of its interaction with gregorio, you can consult the <a href="http://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=en&page=about2">Scribus documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Installation of the additional Scribus files</h3>

<p>To benefit from the import of the gregorio scores, some additional files for Scribus must be installed. These files are available in the <code>contrib/</code> directory of the gregorio sources, and also in the <a href="http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/gregorio/trunk/contrib/">subversion repository</a>. These files are gregorio-scribus.lua,  900_gregorio.xml and gregorio.png. If you are under Windows, it's better to take them that have been installed with the automatic installer, they are in <code>C:\Program Files\Gregorio\contrib</code> (assuming you have gregorio installed here).</p>

<p class="nofirst">If you are under Mac or if you have installed Gregorio under Windows with the advanced method, you need to slightly modify these files to adapt them to your system. These modifications are described in the comments of the file <code>900_gregorio.xml</code>.</p>

<p class="nofirst">Finally, you need to make Scribus use these files. To do so go in <code>File/Preferences</code>, and then, in the <code>External Tools</code> part, in <code>Render Frames</code>, click on add and select the file 900_gregorio.xml in the <code>contrib/</code> directory of the gregorio installation. An interesting trick if you use only gregorio score import, is to make gregorio the first of the list, in order to use it by default. To do so click on <code>Up</code> several times. Click on <code>Apply</code> then <code>OK</code>, and it's done.</p>

<h3>Use in Scribus</h3>

<p>The use fo gregorio inside Scribus is almost the same as the LaTeX one: click on <code>Insert/Insert Render Frame</code>, then select the area in which you want a score to appear. Right-click on this area and click on <code>Edit Source</code>, and the editor will open.</p>

<p class="nofirst">First select gregorio in the program list (if it's not by default). The left text area allows you to enter the gabc code of the score. Two other tabs are present: one to add some packages to the LaTeX header, and one to put some GregorioTeX commands.</p>

<p class="nofirst">The rendering may be scary at first, but in fact it's only the preview that has a low quality, which is not the case of the final rendering; which you will see if you export in PDF.</p>

<p class="nofirst">When you will try to export a PDF, scribus will output some warnings, you can ignore them safely. Also you will need to check the box <code>Embed EPS &amp; PDF files (EXPERIMENTAL)</code>. If you cannot check this box (it happens on certain versions, especially under Linux), the scores will be included as images, which can introduce pixelization. To improve the quality of the images, you can change the value of the option <code>Resolution for EPS Graphics</code>; 600dpi is a standard value for desktop printers. Note that in this case the produced PDF will be as much as 10 times heavier.</p>
